remortgage package. 
Our standard legal service will include solicitor’s fees directly relating to the remortgage (registered land only) and Land Registry fees. It does not include any other legal 
fees, money transfer fees or additional fees incurred in connection with dealing with leasehold, shared ownership properties or registration fees relating to Sasine 
properties in Scotland. It also excludes other mortgage charges or changes to mortgage parties. So, in the case of a remortgage where it includes, for example, a change 
of names on the mortgage or the first registration of unregistered land, you will be liable for any associated fees. You will be advised by your solicitor of additional costs

to status and a minimum age of 18. Mortgages are subject to valuation. A first charge over your property is required. The mortgage is available on an interest only and / or 
repayment basis. For an interest only mortgage, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient funds to repay the mortgage at the end of its term. The 
minimum age for taking out a mortgage with Barclays is 18. Usually the maximum age at the end of the mortgage term should be 70 or your retirement age – whichever 
is sooner. Where the end of term date of the mortgage would be later than this for any applicant, applications may still be considered on an individual basis. Mortgages are

solicitors who act on our behalf only. The legal service is not available should a customer choose not to use the appointed panel solicitor. Customers will not pay for or receive a copy 
of the non-disclosed valuation report. Switch & Save™ products are generally only available to customers who have a mortgage with another lender (not Barclays or Woolwich), who 
want to move their mortgage to us and are not moving home. In the case of a remortgage where it includes, for example, a change of names on the mortgage or the first registration

remortgage package: Our standard legal service will include solicitor’s fees directly relating to the remortgage (registered land only) and Land Registry 
fees. It does not include any other legal fees, money transfer fees or additional fees incurred in connection with dealing with leasehold, shared ownership properties or 
registration fees relating to Sasine properties in Scotland. It also excludes other mortgage charges or changes to mortgage parties. So, in the case of a remortgage where it 
includes, for example, a change of names on the mortgage or the first registration of unregistered land, you will be liable for any associated fees. You will be advised by
